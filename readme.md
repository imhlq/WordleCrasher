# Wordle Crasher

This is a solver of the [wordle game](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html) with personal strategy.

## Getting Start

1. requirements: python3

2. run program
```
python helper.py
```

3. Interactive with the program to solve the game

## Something to know

This solver is not at all the best(SOTA) solver of the wordle game. A general wordle solver is based on an information entropy strategy. 

Here is a great introduction video on this: [Solving Wordle using information theory](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v68zYyaEmEA). While please ignore his conclusion due to the mistake he made. 

And you can find the bot leaderboard based on this strategy [here](https://freshman.dev/wordle/#/leaderboard).

## Why this program

If there is the best solution, why do I still make another *bad* solver here in this repo?

**Life** is not choosing the best****. 
If there exists a machine that could give humans the best solution to their final purpose (money, reputation, etc.). Will everyone follow the given route step by step? We are human, we are not machines! We like to live like a human rather than take the all best like a machine.

1. Firstly, the program would **give your personal options/suggestions rather than optimal solutions**.

2. Secondly, the program **do not assume you made the optimal attempt as most bots did**.

All in all, free to use and have fun!
