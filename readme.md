# Wordle Crasher

This is a solver for the [Wordle game](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html) with a unique, personal strategy.

## Getting Started

1. Requirements: Python 3
   - Ensure Python 3 is installed on your machine.
   - Install any necessary dependencies with:
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

2. Run the program:
   ```bash
   python helper.py

3. Follow the prompts and interact with the program to receive suggestions for solving the Wordle game.

## Something to know

This solver is not the best or state-of-the-art (SOTA) solver for Wordle. Most general solvers are based on an information entropy strategy, which you can learn more about in this video: [Solving Wordle using information theory](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v68zYyaEmEA). However, please ignore his conclusion due to the mistake he made. 

You can view a leaderboard of bot solvers based on these strategies [here](https://freshman.dev/wordle/#/leaderboard).

## Why this program

If there are optimal solvers, why create another solver that isn't as effective?

**Because life is not about always choosing the best solution.** Humans are not machines. While machines can offer the "best" route to a goal (money, reputation, etc.), humans often prefer to make decisions that are personal or unique.

- This program will suggest personal options, not always the optimal solutions.

- The program assumes you may not have made the optimal guesses and adjusts accordingly.

All in all, free to use and have fun!
